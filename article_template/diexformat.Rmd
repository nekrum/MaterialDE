author_contributions: |
  Please provide details of author contributions here.


abstract: |
  Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words in a single paragraph. Abstracts should explain to the general reader the major contributions of the article. References in the abstract must be cited in full within the abstract itself and cited in the text.


significance: |
  Authors must submit a 120-word maximum statement about the significance of their research paper written at a level understandable to an undergraduate educated scientist outside their field of speciality. The primary goal of the Significance Statement is to explain the relevance of the work in broad context to a broad readership. The Significance Statement appears in the paper itself and is required for all research papers.

acknowledgements: |
  Please include your acknowledgments here, set in a single paragraph. Please do not include any acknowledgments in the Supporting Information, or anywhere else in the manuscript.

This  template is provided to help you write your work in the
correct journal format. Instructions for use are provided below.

Note: please start your introduction without including the word
"Introduction" as a section heading (except for math articles in the
Physical Sciences section); this heading is implied in the first
paragraphs.

Guide to using this template {.unnumbered}
========================================

Please note that whilst this template provides a preview of the typeset
manuscript for submission, to help in this preparation.


Author Affiliations {#author-affiliations .unnumbered}
-------------------

Include group, generation and year


Format {#format .unnumbered}
------

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the
following order of sections; Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords,
Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and
methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are
permitted.

Manuscript Length {#manuscript-length .unnumbered}
-----------------

This format uses a two-column format averaging 67 characters,
including spaces, per line. 

References {#references .unnumbered}
----------

References should be cited in numerical order as they appear in text;
this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. @belkin2002using and
@berard1994embedding [@coifman2005geometric]. All references, including
for the SI, should be included in the main manuscript file. References
appearing in both sections should not be duplicated. SI references
included in tables should be included with the main reference section.

justification setting.<span data-label="fig:frog"></span>](frog.png)

Digital Figures {#sec:figures .unnumbered}
---------------

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

Figure \[fig:frog\] shows an example of how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. Figures wider than one
column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide.

Single column equations {#single-column-equations .unnumbered}
-----------------------

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \[eqn:example\] below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

$$\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \label{eqn:example} \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
\end{aligned}$$

### Appendices {#appendices .unnumbered}

It is possible to add supplementary information to clarify the content,
But they must be short and summarized.

### Setting Bibliography {#set_bibio .unnumbered}

The bibliography must be added into an bib file in order to allow latex 
to generate bibliography.
